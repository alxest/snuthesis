Modern software systems are large and complex; they are composed of
multiple modules written in different languages such as C and
handwritten assembly.
%% Moreover, each module is then compiled down to machine code by multi-pass compilers utilizing complex translations.
Moreover, each module is then compiled down to machine code by possibly different compilers, each utilizing multiple optimizations.
To verify such a system, it is critically important to have a modular
verification technique that allows proof engineers to focus on a
single module and its single translation at a time.

The two state-of-the-art frameworks, CompCertX and Compositional
CompCert, supporting modular verification of heterogeneous systems
take different approaches. The former simplifies the problem by
imposing restrictions that the source modules should have no mutual
dependence and be verified against certain well-behaved
specifications. On the other hand, the latter develops a new
verification technique that directly solves the problem but at the
expense of significantly increasing the verification cost.



In this dissertation, we develop a novel lightweight verification technique,
called RUSC (Refinement Under Self-related Contexts), and demonstrate
how RUSC can solve the problem without any restrictions but still with
low verification overhead. For this, we develop CompCertM, a full
extension of the latest version of CompCert supporting multi-language
linking. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of RUSC as a program
verification technique by modularly verifying interesting programs
consisting of C and handwritten assembly against their mathematical
specifications.
