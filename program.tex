\chapter{\;\;\;\;Program Verification}
\label{sec:program}

In this chapter, we will show the potential of RUSC-as-a-program-logic with interesting examples and give a comprehensive comparison with modern variants of Hoare logic (such as \cite{VST}), arguably the most successful and widely used program verification technique so far.
We first give a short introduction to Hoare logic (\Cref{sec:program:background}), discuss its problems (\Cref{sec:program:problem}), and present how we verify interesting examples without the aforementioned problems (\Cref{sec:program:solution}).
However, RUSC-as-a-program-logic is still in its early stage, so we clarify its current limitations, compare it with Hoare logic, and discuss future research directions (\Cref{sec:program:future}).
Finally, we list up related works (\Cref{sec:program:related}).
