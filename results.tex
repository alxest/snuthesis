%% two symbol relations: \emph{identity} for keeping identical symbols in the source and target,
%% and \emph{elimglob} for eliminating selected global variables in the target,
%% which is needed for \code{Unusedglob} and \code{Unreadglob};
%% and $(iii)$ two memory predicates: \emph{none} for 

%% with different combinations of parameters.  As parameters, we
%% use four memory relations: identity, extension, and injection for \cc{} optimizations, and injection
%% with module-local invariants for \code{Unreadglob}; two symbol relations: ``drop'' for
%% \code{Unusedglob} and \code{Unreadglob}, and identity for the other optimizations; and two memory
%% predicates: one for value analysis, and the stub predicate for modeling the absence of analysis.


%% \youngju{In overview we said elim-unread-glob, unify it}

% Basically, all four cases use trivial relations for \textrm{SymbRel}, that asserts source/target
% \Skel are equal, and \textrm{MemPred}, whose predicate is always true.  Nevertheless,
% \textrm{SymbRel} has one variant (drop instance for Unusedglob and Unreadglob) and
% \textrm{MemPred} also has one variant (unreach instance for value analysis).

% We use four different \textrm{MemRel} instances (identity, extension, injection, injection with
% private invariants).  Basically, all four cases use trivial relations for \textrm{SymbRel}, that
% asserts source/target \Skel are equal, and \textrm{MemPred}, whose predicate is always true.
% Nevertheless, \textrm{SymbRel} has one variant (drop instance for Unusedglob and Unreadglob) and
% \textrm{MemPred} also has one variant (unreach instance for value analysis).


% \todo{Mention that asm verification is hard. -- later say that VST is needed.}

% ``Pass Proof'' is actually easy --- merely proving trivial things for four primitive cases and some boilerplate code.
% ``Interaction Semantics'' is ... \youngju{currently splitting some files}

% ``Language Semantics'' is ... 11 languages. Defining four primitives, boilerplate codes, and proving determinate/receptive.

% ``Self Simulation'' is easy.

% ``CompCert Meta'' is \todo{break it down}
% ``CompCertM Meta'' contains some lemmas about argument passing, definiton of open sim and its instantiations, its property (adequacy).
% ``Mixed Simulation'' is mixed sim.
% ``Adq. w.r.t. C'' is quite long because C language has too many cases.
